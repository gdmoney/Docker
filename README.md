# Notes

## General
**Container**
- system isolation method provided in Linux that’s more lightweight than a VM

**Docker**
- tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers
- PaaS product that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers

**Image**
- a container is launched by running an image
- an image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application:
- the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files

**Container**
- a runtime instance of an image
- what the image becomes in memory when executed
- that is, an image with state, or a user process

**Volume**
- way to store files in the host machine, so that files are persisted even after the container stops
- are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux`)
- preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers


## Networking
- Linux network namespaces (netns) provides complete isolation 
- each container runs in a separate namespace and can't communicate with another container by default
- physical network interfaces are only accessible to apps running in the default namespace
- IP addresses are automatically assigned to containers
- VEth				
  - virtual cable for connecting two namespaces/containers
  - one end of the VEth gets renamed to eth0 inside the container, the other end connects to the bridge

### Networking drivers (modes)
**Bridge (dflt)**		
- connects multiple VEths together and to the host physical interface
- default name is `Docker0` and it runs in the default namespace
- containers connected to the same bridge can communicate to each other but not to containers connected to a different bridge
- containers can be connected to multiple bridges
- NAT to communicate with the outside world
- the default bridge network is NOT recommended for production; use a user-defined bridge instead

**Host**			
- removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host
- container uses the host’s networking directly
- no NAT or namespace separation, all interfaces on the host can be used directly by the container
- can be useful for standalone containers to optimize performance

**Overlay**			
- creates an overlay network over physical network for container-to-container communication
- each container gets 2 virtual interfaces and 2 bridges are created
- one bridge for physical network communication; another bridge for VxLAN communication (`docker_gwbridge`)
